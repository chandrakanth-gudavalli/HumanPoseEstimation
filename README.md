# Human Pose Estimation
A deep learning model to estimate the pose of human body.

## Run Imstructions:
1. Run getModels.sh from command line.
2. Run all cells in "OpenPose_Notebook.ipynb"

## Applications
1. This models helps us to track the body language of soccer players and analyse their strengths and weak points.
2. Can detect robbers at ATM stations, etc.

## Limitations and Future Scope
This model is working well with images having only one human. This should be enhanced to handle images with more than one person.
